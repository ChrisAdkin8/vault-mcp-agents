"""Session context that carries authenticated identity through the call chain.

Pattern: Session Context Propagation
-------------------------------------
A single ``Session`` object is created after the human authenticates via Vault
and is threaded through every downstream call — agent construction, MCP server
initialisation, and GCP credential requests.  This avoids scattering identity
state across disconnected modules and makes the security boundary explicit: if
a component does not receive a Session, it cannot act on behalf of a user.

The session is intentionally immutable after creation.  Credential refresh is
handled by obtaining a new session rather than mutating the existing one.
